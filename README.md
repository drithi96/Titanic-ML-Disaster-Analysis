# Titanic-ML-Disaster-Analysis
Analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic Disaster applying tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
<br> Software: Used R Studio for this project.

<strong> Goal </strong>
<br> To predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test, there is prediction of 0 or 1 value for the variable.

<strong> Data </strong>
<br> train.csv is used to build machine learning models and is based on "features" like passengers' gender and class.
<br> test.csv is used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. Model is trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

<strong> Final File </strong> 
<br> final_file.csv has two columns "PassengerId" and "Survived" based on the predictions made on R studio.
