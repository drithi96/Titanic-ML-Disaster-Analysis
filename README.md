# Titanic-ML-Disaster-Analysis
Analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic Disaster applying tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
Used R Studio for this project.

<strong> Goal </strong>
To predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test, there is prediction of 0 or 1 value for the variable.

Data
train.csv is used to build machine learning models and is based on "features" like passengers' gender and class.
test.csv is used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. Model is trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

Final File
Has two columns "PassengerId" and "Survived" based on the predictions made on R studio.
